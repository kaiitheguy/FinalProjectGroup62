## DATA SCIENCE QUESTION(S) & HYPOTHESIS: 

The specific question we are trying to solve in this project is how can we reduce the amount of alcohol consumption amongst high school students? Our data set gives us information about not only about the amount of alcohol a student consumes on weekdays and weekends, but it also includes a lot of background information on the students, like their family financial status, parent’s occupation, grades, and amount of free time they have. This project will narrow down the data by focusing on trying to find a correlation between student alcohol consumption and whether a student participates in extracurricular activities. 

Our hypothesis is that student alcohol consumption is correlated with extracurricular activities and that if a student does participate in extracurricular activities, their alcohol consumption will be relatively less than their counterparts. This is due to the assumption that if a student is busy with extracurriculars, they will have less time to consume alcohol.

## BACKGROUND:

Unhealthy alcohol use among students is a major public health concern. Although there are already many research reports(Reference 1 and 3) showing the level of alcohol consumption among undergraduate students, the research on the alcohol consumption level of high school students is still almost blank. The aim of the current research is to describe drinking patterns of US high school students along with their family backgrounds. From doing background research, we identified several common leads and motives in teenager alcohol usage(References 4 and 5). From those studies, we found that family backgrounds, including parents marriage status, parents degree, parents financial status and etc, is a crucial attributive cause in teenager alcohol usage. So we decided to research the correlation between alcohol usage and family backgrounds. We also learned how to better measure alcohol consumption(Reference 2) so that we could relate alcohol consumption better with usage and have a better understanding of the dataset(Reference 6) we are using.

In conclusion, the correlation we want to find out should be lined along with the age of students. Using the dataset in Reference 6, we could get data of level of student alcohol consumption, students’ age, and their family background information.


## ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: 
An ethical issue we need to consider for our project is privacy. We are exploring a topic that not only reveals that the number of students who perform underage drinking but also forces us to analyze their personal background. The dataset we are using contains a lot of personal information about each student, such as their sex, age, address, family size, parental cohabitation status, parent’s education level, parent’s jobs, the reason they chose to attend their school, guardian, travel time from home to school, study time, number of failed classes, whether they receive extra educational support, whether they receive family education support, whether they take extra paid classes, extracurricular classes, and whether they attended nursery school. Although these data sets consists of a lot of data about each student’s personal background, we justified the use of this dataset because a majority of the information provided to us is binary or numerical, which means that we do not have access to the details of these aspects of their lives. For example, we do not actually have access to their specific addresses. Instead, we only know if they live in a rural or urban area. The information we will analyze is very general and privacy is not entirely a huge issue in this case. However, we will continue to acknowledge how this information is still private to some extent as we work on our project.

## TEAM EXPECTATIONS 
We expect each group member to be respectful and considerate of one another. We expect each team member to complete their assigned tasks to the best of their abilities, and to ask for help from other members if they are having difficulty. We expect everyone to attend our weekly meetings, and in the event that they do miss a meeting, they must be diligent in making up anything they have missed and knowing what was assigned during the meeting. We expect all members to be active in the dialogue and the direction of the team, and to be active and engaging with their teammates.
